As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution automates the configuration of the following AWS services and features:

* AWS Security Hub for aggregating, organizing, and prioritizing your security alerts and findings from AWS services. 
* AWS Backup for centrally managing and automating backups across AWS services.
* AWS Budgets for configuring cost threshold alarms. 
* Preventative guardrails with service control policies that protect the infrastructure from intentional or unintentional mistakes, such as using restricted AWS Regions, deleting backup copies, and deactivating security features.
* AWS Systems Manager, including its OpsCenter resource for viewing, investigating, and resolving operational issues.
* Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) for providing secure mailboxes and IT service catalog aliases for all root accounts.
* Amazon CloudWatch dashboard with information and links to resources, such as how to set up your AWS account, how to set up SSO with existing identity providers, and how to access GuardDuty and Security Hub dashboards.
* Feature flippers for gradually enabling functionality as needed.
